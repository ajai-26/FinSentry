>>> How to Run This Project
Step 0: Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, open your terminal (Command Prompt) and install the required libraries.

# First, navigate to your project folder
# Example: T:
# cd "D:\FinSentry –  AI-Powered Fraud Detection System sss"

# Then, install the libraries
py -m pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib imbalanced-learn xgboost flask

Step 1: Train the Model (The "Factory")
First, you need to run the training pipeline to generate the model files (.pkl). This script takes the raw creditcard.csv data and produces the three model artifacts.

In your terminal, from the project's root directory, run:

py fraud_detection_pipeline.py

This will load the data, train the model, and save fraud_model.pkl, scaler.pkl, and feature_order.pkl in the same directory. This step may take a few minutes to complete.

Step 2: Run the Web Application (The "Storefront")
Once the model files are created, you can start the Flask web server. This server will remain running in the background to handle prediction requests.

In the same terminal, run:

py app.py

The terminal will show that the server is running and listening on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Step 3: Use the Interface
Open your web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) and navigate to the following address:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

You can now use the interface to populate sample data using the buttons and get live predictions from your fully operational model.
